<p class="lead">
  <i>The Quick Python Book, Fourth Edition</i> by Naomi Ceder is a comprehensive guide designed to help readers learn Python from the ground up. After an eight-year hiatus from Python, I picked up this book to reacquaint myself with Python 3.x, and it largely delivered on that goal.
</p>

The book covers a broad range of Python fundamentals, from basic syntax and data types to more advanced topics like object-oriented programming, file handling, and working with databases. Ceder's writing style is clear and approachable, making complex concepts accessible to both newcomers and those returning to the language after some time away.

However, the book is quite a lengthy read. Some chapters feel unnecessarily drawn out, covering topics in more detail than perhaps warranted for a book with "Quick" in its title. Given the substantial page count, I expected the book to venture into more advanced territory, particularly **async programming**, which has become increasingly important in modern Python development. Its absence is a notable gap, especially considering how prevalent asynchronous patterns have become in web development, API design, and concurrent programming.

One aspect I particularly appreciated was the inclusion of generative AI content. The book explores how AI would approach and solve the problems presented throughout the chapters, along with analysis of how AI code assistants tackle these challenges. This modern perspective adds practical value and reflects the reality of contemporary software development.

Despite these shortcomings, *The Quick Python Book* remains a solid choice for anyone looking to build a strong foundation in Python. The book excels at explaining core concepts thoroughly, and the practical examples help reinforce learning. For developers like myself who needed to refresh their Python knowledge after years of working with other languages, it serves as an effective bridge back into the Python ecosystem.

**Verdict:** A good, comprehensive introduction to Python 3.x that would benefit from being more concise and including coverage of modern async patterns. Recommended for beginners and those returning to Python after an extended break.
