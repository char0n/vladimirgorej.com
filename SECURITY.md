## Reporting a Bug

I will take all security bugs in vladimirgorej.com seriously.
Thank you for improving the security of vladimirgorej.com. I appreciate your efforts and
responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your
contributions.

Report security bugs by emailing the lead maintainer at **vladimir.gorej@gmail.com**.

I will acknowledge your email within 48 hours, and will send a
more detailed response within 48 hours indicating the next steps in handling
your report. After the initial reply to your report, I will
endeavor to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full
announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining
the module, but still let me know that we have such a third-party module in our
dependencies.

## Disclosure Policy

When I receive a security bug report, I will assign it to a
primary handler (in 99% cases me). I will coordinate the fix and release process,
involving the following steps:

  * Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
  * Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
  * Prepare fixes. These fixes will be released and deployed as fast as possible to vladimirgorej.com.

## Comments on this Policy

If you have suggestions on how this process could be improved please submit a
pull request.

Thank you, Vladim√≠r Gorej
